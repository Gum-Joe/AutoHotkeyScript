;THIS IS A GREAT FIRST SCRIPT FOR AHK NOOBS! IT WORKS WITH VERY LITTLE SETUP. JUST READ THE STUFF BELOW! YAY! 
;VIDEO EXPLANATION:  https://youtu.be/O6ERELse_QY?t=23m40s

; +++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++
; NOTE THAT YOU MUST ASSIGN \ (backslash) to "Move playhead to cursor" in Premiere's keyboard shortcuts panel!
; YOU SHOULD ALSO ASSIGN CTRL ALT D to "DESELECT ALL" 
; +++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++

;NOTE: I use the right mouse button for this because my current mouse does not have macro keys on it. I could use the middle mouse button, but it requires too much pressure to push down so often, and you have to be careful not to accidentally scroll it.
;But if you want to use a button other than the right mouse button, the script becomes a lot simpler. Scroll down to the bottom for that script.

;NOTE: This does not, and cannot work on the timeline where there are no tracks visible.
;Explanation: https://twitter.com/boxrNathan/status/927371468371103745
;That is color 0x212121, and last I checked, it shows up in many other places in premiere, not just that part of the timeline.
;The easy solution is to just fill up your timeline with tracks; have no blank space.

;---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

;First, we define all the timeline's DEFAULT possible colors.
;(Note that your colors will be different if you changed the UI brightness inside preferences > appearance > brightness.)
;I used Window Spy (it comes with AHK) to detect the exact colors onscreen.
Global timeline1 = 0x414141 ;timeline color inside the in/out points ON a targeted track
Global timeline2 = 0x313131 ;timeline color of the separating LINES between targeted AND non targeted tracks inside the in/out points
Global timeline3 = 0x1b1b1b ;the timeline color inside in/out points on a NON targeted track
Global timeline4 = 0x202020 ;the color of the bare timeline NOT inside the in out points
Global timeline5 = 0xDFDFDF ;the color of a SELECTED blank space on the timeline, NOT in the in/out points
Global timeline6 = 0xE4E4E4 ;the color of a SELECTED blank space on the timeline, IN the in/out points, on a TARGETED track
Global timeline7 = 0xBEBEBE ;the color of a SELECTED blank space on the timeline, IN the in/out points, on an UNTARGETED track

;If you don't want to use Rbutton (the right mouse button), then you don't need to check for colors and things. This simplifies the script siginificantly.
;In the following script, You can change "Mbutton" to anything else. like "Xbutton1", or  even "F12" if you wanted.
;So, assuming you've mapped "move playhead to cursor" to the \ key, the problem is that it fires once, waits 1 second, and only then does it continue to fire.
;that's why I use a loop - to send constant keypresses, for a smooth experience.
